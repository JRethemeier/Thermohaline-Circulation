= Exercise 1: Origin and Spread of Antarctic Bottom Water
== a) Decribe the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW)
AABW is mainly formed during formation of sea ice in the southern winter.
As the sea water is cooled below 0°C it sinks below and increses the mixed layer depth (MLD).
The sea ice formation can only start, when the entire mixed layer is cooled to the freezing point of the sea water of $=1.9°C$.
The subsequent freezing process happens relatively fast.
As salt cannot be incorporated into the ice itself, it remains in an increasingly smaller amount of water, forming highly saline brine.
The brine drains out of the ice into the sea and sinks below to the continental shelf.
The salty water on continental shelf comes in contact with the underside of the ice shelf.
Due to the high salinity the ice shelf is melted, freshening the water but also cooling it further down to $-2.1°C$. 
The water is now called ice shelf water and eventually overflows the continental shelf break, falling down the continental shelf.
In the process of flowing downwards it mixes partly with the lower circumpolar deep water achieving its ultimate signature.

== b) Discuss the key features of the distributions. How does the spread of AABW occur in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans?
flows into all three aligned ocean basins. 
The majority of 57% is discharged into the Pacific Ocean, 37% into the Atlantic Ocean and the remaining 5% into the Indian Ocean.
Johnson, 2008 reckoned that 36% of the total ocean volume is made up of AABW.
More than 80% of the AABW formed in the Weddel Sea and along the eastern Antarctic continent are exported into the Atlantic Ocean.
While more than 90% from the Ross Sea are exported into the Pacific Ocean. (Solodoch et al., 2022)

The AABW is moving northwards mostly in the western parts of the ocean basins, as can be seen in the maps for this exercise.
As it has such a high density it flows as deep as possible along the bathymetry.
It cannot cross for example the mid atlantic ridge, however, regions of steep gradients in topography are regions of increased mixing with the waters above.

== c) How has the deep water changed since we have been able to measure it, and what does this mean? What are the consequences?
